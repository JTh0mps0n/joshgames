                        <p>Procedural Animation is simply animation handled in real-time by code rather than baked by an animator. There are multiple ways of implementing Procedural Animation, but in this case this example I made is 100% procedural (No baked animations)</p>

                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>I wanted to make this because I'm fascinated in procedural content and wanted and wanted a model which moved somewhat believably and reacted to the environment in real-time.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, Procedural Animation is great for that because it allows for great flexibility with how an object visually moves, especially because it is calculated in real-time and not baked onto the model. This means that body-parts such as feet can be animated based on conditions such as, elevating/rotating the feet to the environment it is sitting on. Procedural Animation also means that we have full control over the speed/positioning and more of body-parts we may want to animate inside the engine which ultimately means we can create a believable animation for end-users very quickly.</p>
