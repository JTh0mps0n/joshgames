                        <p>Comp280 is a game development module I had during 2nd year at Falmouth University. It involved us student programmers designing a game which had: Behaviour Tree AI, Networking and UI (User Interfaces).</p>

                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>This project was a lot of fun to make and was a great way to learn a new form of AI decision making rather than using a Finite State Machines. Behaviour trees after this module have become one of my favourite ways to design AI systems and I try encorporate them in as many of my projects as I can due to the flexibility they provide.</p>
                <p>In this project, the AI have 3 states... (ATTACK, CHASE, WANDER)</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* ATTACK -</div></p>
                <p>This state will check to see if target is in range and make the AI shoot projectiles at the target.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* CHASE -</div></p>
                <p>This state will check to see if the target can be seen in its range by using raycasts... If it is, will face the target and path towards it using A* pathfinding.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* WANDER -</div></p>
                <p>This state will get the AI to path to random positions on the map using A* pathfinding.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Another mechanic which I am really proud of is that the map is actually procedural generated using a maze generation algorithm called "Recursive Backtracker". This algorithm works by choosing a random neighbour that has not yet been discovered and then move to that one and repeat until no neighbours can be found... Then backtrack to previous iterations until a neighbour can be found again. Doing this repeatedly will create a fully explorable maze which can be seen in the demo below!</p>
