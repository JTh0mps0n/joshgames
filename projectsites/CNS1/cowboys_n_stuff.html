                        <p>Cowboys n' Stuff is a 2D, Top-down, wave-survival orientated game where you control and customise your cowboy in order to eliminate threats as they arrive; whether it is day or night...</p>                        
                        <p></p>
                        <p>* Developed during 2nd year of sixth-form (2019)</p>
                        <p>* Released on steam just before I started my first year at university (10/09/2020)</p>

                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>I developed this game during and outside of sixth-form as a personal project. It was alot of fun and was a great way to test my knowledge of C# and Unity.</p>                
                <p></p>
                <p>Although this was a solo project and infact my first big project, Developing this has been a great experience as it has given me confidence in using both; Unity Engine and the C# language. This project also provided me the fundamental experience needed to experiment with future projects knowing areas I can improve upon and better approaches to problems.</p>                
                <p></p>
                <p>One of my favourite mechanics I programmed for this project has to be the endless system. It was fun trying to figure out a way to increase the difficulty and introduce new enemies into the mix. With that said, I do believe I could improve upon this system now that a couple years have past after developing that mechanic since being at university.</p>
