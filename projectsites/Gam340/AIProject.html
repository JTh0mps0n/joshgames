                        <p>Gam340 is a game development module I had during 3rd year at Falmouth University. It involved students creating a strong artifact to place on our portfolio sites.</p>                        
                        <p></p>
                        <p>For my project, I decided I wanted to create an AI system using behaviour trees which hold various interesting behaviours and systems with the aim of creating an AI which is fun to interact with.</p>                        
                    </div>

            <div class="main-hero"> 
                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>The desire behind this project beyond this module is that I wish to use this system in a game I'm making with someone in my personal time. The idea is that this AI will be highly interactable and lively with behaviours that can be easily applied to characters by changing very little. To do this I have decided to make use of behaviour trees, they mean I can make small classes holding small tasks and then add that class into a tree for the AI to process.<p>
                <p></p>
                <p>To make this AI appear interactable and lively it is important that it has a variety of sensors to capture data rather than knowing everything around it at all times. To achieve this, the AI is equipped with Vision cones, "Hearing" and Memory which removes captured data after x amount of seconds.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* Vision Cones -</div></p>
                <p>This component is the core part which will result in tasks being appended into memory. It creates a cone infront of the object which changes size based on scene lighting and ultimately resembles it being harder to see in the dark. Any object which is meant to trigger code will be compared to a list of behaviours the AI can do based on its personality (As labelled in a settings script made for this AI system) and then add a given task into memory. For example, If this agent is a rabbit and is skittish towards players then a player enters its vision, the rabbit will flee.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* Hearing -</div></p>
                <p>This component is not yet designed as of writing this. However, the conceptual idea of how this will work will act similar to how the vision works in the way where it will check up to a given distance and will check for objects that are moving. It will then calculate a curiosity value based on the duration the character moves for, how "heavy" a character may be and how close the noise is coming from. If the curiosity value exceeds a threshold, the AI may choose to do a variety of tasks which may range from, facing the direction the noise is coming from, moving or fleeing to or from that general position. This will also have to use raycasts to see if the object is inside a building though as that will dampen the noise quite a bit.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">* Memory -</div></p>
                <p>This component holds tasks which are acquired from the tasks in the behaviour tree which read from the above sensors. It also deletes data after x amount of seconds. The data that is held inside memory consists of (Data lifetime, Task priority, Target object, Last recorded position, The task that needs to be carried out). The AI will read from memory and figure out which task should be completed first based on the priority variable.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Another topic of interest when it comes to AI is locomotion. I wanted the AI to look less robot-y when moving so looked into applying steering behaviours into the core of them. This means that they will more often than not curve towards their targets when turning, it also means that they will avoid colliders when moving to a given position. To add to this, I plan on adding A* grid based pathfinding to this project at a later date but as of right now, a working solution of the steering behaviours are inside the project.</p>
