                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>In Gruttel Scuttle I took on the core gameplay programmer role. I programmed a whole variety of mechanics and helped out with a fair amount of issues raised from the other programmers on the team. This project is made with C# and Unity and really allowed me to test out my skills with the C# language.</p>                
                <p></p>
                <p>* Gameplay loop - I programmed the gameplay loop for this game which made heavy use of a behaviour tree algorithm in order to process each state the game needed to be in. I believe this to be a great idea because it provided a way to add a variety of behaviours into each state and easily see what state the game is in. It also provided an easy way for designers to decide what happens in each state.</p>
                <p>* Regions - This is one of the first mechanics I programmed for this game, it provided a way for designers to define areas in the map where game events occur... For example you could define a region as a 'Litter Region' and that would then be an area litter would be thrown inside. Another pre-defined region is a 'Home' region which is where Gruttels would go after they have picked up litter.</p>
                <p>* Litter Throwing - This was added mid-way through the development of Gruttel Scuttle. It uses an algorithm called "Ballistic Trajectory", this algorithm calculates the angle and force needed in order to shoot objects to land at a certain position. I tapped into my region script with this to get a random position inside the region and this would then shoot litter into that region at the random position inside that region.</p>
                <p>* Gruttel Selection - This is one of the last mechanics introduced into the project. It taps into another programmers script and allows one to select the Gruttels they wish to play with and then add 'powerups' to some of those Gruttels to allow them to pick up unique pieces of litter. This system alongside my other mechanics I programmed were plugged into my gameplay loop to get everything operating in the correct order.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>My favourite mechanic introduced would be either the Gameplay loop or the Litter Throwing mechanic. Gameplay loop would be because of the behaviour-tree. I find it so much fun implementing these types of decision systems. It makes the workflow of introducing mechanics easier and faster and also provides an easily customisable system for designers. The Litter Throwing mechanic was fun to make as well, especially with the testing portion of it. I was spawning 100s of objects a second and trying to get them landing at a point, then moving that point in real-time - Watching the shooting object rotate to ensure the objects land at the correct position.</p>
