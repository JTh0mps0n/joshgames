                <p>Look at Ember bot's source code <a href='https://github.com/JoshTGames/EmberBot' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' id='embedURL'>here!</a></p>
                <!-- INSERT BOT IMAGE HERE -->
                <p>This bot has a variety of features, primarily being a tool for teams during university to help students achieve SCRUM (Agile) methodology in their routine with software development. It creates temporary chat-rooms called 'Threads' which are timestamped and archived after the day has passed, these chat-rooms are designed so that students can input what they have done, what they want to do, if they have any blockers in the way and when they believe for it to be completed.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Another feature this bot has is for our universities peer review tool called 'feedback fruits'. This feature speeds up the reviewing process by generating the feedback for a student based on a variety of options provided to the reviewer.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">Reminder bot</div></p>
                <p>Look at Reminder bot's source code <a href='https://github.com/JoshTGames/Reminder-bot' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' id='embedURL'>here!</a></p>
                <!-- INSERT BOT IMAGE HERE -->
                <p>The purpose of this bot is to allow users to create re-occuring reminders within discord. I made this bot because discord pings my computer and my phone and therefore no matter where I am, as long as I am connected to the internet I can recieve reminders for example, 'Drink water'.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">Bin bot</div></p>
                <p>Look at Bin bot's source code <a href='https://github.com/JoshTGames/Bin-bot' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' id='embedURL'>here!</a></p>
                <!-- INSERT BOT IMAGE HERE -->
                <p>This bot has been made for convenience of discord moderators as it allows users who have permission by the server this bot is present in to clear chat messages in bulk. Which without, is quite a tedious task if there are a lot of messages which are needing to be removed. This bot has a few commands which can make this less of a tedious task. such as, removing ALL messages in a chat-room, removing all messages by a given user in a chat-room and removing 'x' amount of messages from newest to oldest in a chat-room.</p>
