                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>In Conjoined Game I took on the gameplay programmer role. I programmed a whole variety of features and assisted our other programmer with issues in their code. This project is made with C# and Unity.</p>                
                <p><div class = "list">Player Controller</div></p>
                <p>The player controller provides a smooth and responsive experience yet feeling heavy to match the protagonist you play as during this game. It features multiple attacks which can be triggered with various buttons and used to strategically take down enemies in the game. In addition, there is camera collision so that the camera doesn't "phase" through objects.</p>
                <p><div class = "list">UI</div></p>
                <p>Conjoined Game features various UI to reveal important information to the player. In this case, for the health interface it shows a silhouette of the character which is animated to show the actions of the player e.g. idle/walking/running/jumping/landing. The health is visualised as the same image overlayed ontop; in a different colour which drains/fills based on the health of the character.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The stamina UI shows itself when stamina is not full and gradually grows after a period of time after the player stops sprinting.</p>
