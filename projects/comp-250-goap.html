                        <p>Comp250 is a game development module for us programmers back in 2nd year at Falmouth University. It tasked us to create a type of AI algorithm of our choosing.</p>                        
                        <p>I decided I wanted to program a GOAP algorithm because I remember seeing the algorithm being talked about in a youtube video and being amazed at the possibilities it has to offer.</p>                        
                        <p></p>
                        <p>GOAP is a decision based AI algorithm which seperates actions from goals (tasks) and will use A* pathfinding to select the cheapest set of actions to achieve a goal.</p>

                <h2 id="section-heading">My Involvement</h2>
                <p>For this project I decided I wanted to use procedural animation. Therefore, I wrote a similar system to that I used when making the 3D procedural animation as seen <a href='/projects/pcg-animation/3d-pcg-animation.html' id='embedURL'>here</a>. With that said, because it is 2D and of a top-down perspective it didn't need to be as complex as the 3D counterpart. It then sprung to mind that a spider-ish character could make best use of this system.</p>                
                <p></p>                
                <p>When trying to think of a good case to use the GOAP algorithm, I came to the conclusion that burger assembly could be quite fun and therefore I made a simulation where you have buttons on the middle left of the screen to select a burger you would like to see the spiders make. The spiders will start by setting up the scene; turning on the lights, equipment and stocking storage. And finally after those tasks are complete, the chef will put on its hat and they will all start getting the ingredients required to make that burger.</p>
